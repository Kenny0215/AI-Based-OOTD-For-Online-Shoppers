# 🧠 AI-Based OOTD (Outfit of the Day) for Online Shoppers

An intelligent fashion recommendation system designed to enhance the **online shopping experience** by integrating **AI-driven outfit recommendations**, **virtual try-on (VTON)** visualization, and an **interactive chatbot assistant**.  
This project aims to help users discover, visualize, and interact with fashion choices through a seamless and engaging AI interface.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. **To develop an AI recommendation module** that suggests clothing combinations based on user preferences and outfit attributes.  
2. **To implement a virtual try-on system (VTON)** that enables users to visualize recommended outfits on their own images.  
3. **To design a fashion chatbot assistant** that allows natural interaction with the system for outfit recommendations, virtual try-ons, and fashion tips.  
4. **To improve the online shopping experience** by providing intelligent, interactive, and personalized fashion suggestions.  

---

## 📘 Project Scope

The **AI-Based OOTD for Online Shoppers** system focuses on:

- **Recommendation Intelligence** — generating suitable outfit combinations using rule-based knowledge.  
- **Visualization Experience** — providing realistic outfit try-on simulation through VTON techniques using GenAI API call. 
- **Conversational Assistance** — enabling users to communicate with the system using a chatbot interface.  

> The project does not include real-time e-commerce transactions but focuses on the intelligent fashion recommendation pipeline.

## 📚 Literature Review Summary

Fashion recommendation systems have evolved from simple attribute-based filtering to advanced **AI-driven personalization**.  
Research indicates that **computer vision and deep learning** can effectively analyze fashion features like color, texture, and compatibility.  
Key developments in the field include:

| Study | Focus | Key Findings |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Han et al. (2017) – *FashionNet* | Outfit compatibility learning | Deep neural networks can model clothing relationships and aesthetics effectively. |
| Jetchev & Bergmann (2018) – *Conditional VTON* | Virtual try-on using GANs | Image-based try-on models improve user visualization accuracy. |
| Wang et al. (2020) – *FashionBERT* | Multimodal embeddings | Combining text and image features enhances outfit understanding. |
| Recent Trends (2023–2024) | Chat-based retail assistants | NLP-based chatbots improve personalization and user engagement. |

The integration of **recommendation, visualization, and conversational AI** forms the backbone of modern intelligent shopping systems — which this project aims to replicate in a simplified, modular structure.

## 🧩 System Modules Overview

### 🧠 **Module 1: AI-Based Recommendation System**
- Suggests outfit combinations based on color harmony, texture, and style.  
- Uses image feature extraction and similarity-based matching to generate recommendations.
  
**Output:** Recommended outfit images.  

---

### 🧥 **Module 2: Virtual Try-On (VTON)**
- Allows users to visualize how recommended outfits appear on their uploaded image.  
- Uses image segmentation, warping, and blending techniques.
- Using the GenAI API call to implement the functions.

**Output:** Realistic visualization of user wearing the selected outfit.

---

### 💬 **Module 3: Fashion Chatbot (AI Shopping Assistant)**
- Provides a conversational interface for user interaction.  
- Detects user intents (recommend outfit) and triggers corresponding modules.  
- Offers styling tips and answers basic fashion-related questions.  

**Output:** Chat-based recommendations and interactive responses.
